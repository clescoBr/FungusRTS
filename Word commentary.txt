The main change we have made was the colored dice not long ago, during Deli's visit he mentioned how it was problematic to point which number one wanted, not quite a big issue but a nuisance for sure. We also found a problem when the game turned into a 1v1, in case of 2 identical numbers that Surprisingly was happening often, both players would get the same amount of points no matter what, it was as if the game was not progressing at all.
One day while testing we took 4 different dice and that resulted into an idea with great potential. Because each diceâ€™s color was unique I proposed choosing a color instead of a number to get the points, this would also solve the issue of 2 players getting the same points when 2 identical numbers fall to the table. When picking a color you may still pick the same dice so the risk of losing points is always there. The color can be chosen in a couple of different ways which can be accomplished through pointing at the wanted color on nearby chips or by making special cards that one throws on the table simultaneously with his teammates.
